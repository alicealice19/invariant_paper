The supplementary material contains the source code of the sample classes
from the article. The code was prettied for readability and can be compiled
by EiffelStudio 20.11 using the project file "example.ecf".

Directory structure:

	src     - the original code from the article (pretty-printed)
	release - the same code with minor changes to follow conventions
	          of EiffelStudio 20.11 to access items being iterated
	          in the loop

This supplementary material is not a subject for artifact evaluation that
is submitted separately and includes the code with dynamic checks of the
proofs included in the article.
